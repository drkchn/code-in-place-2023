from graphics import Canvas

"""
Your job is to write a program that draws a circle wherever the mouse is located on the screen. The user will move their mouse within the canvas, and a circle should be drawn with its left and top x and y values as the x and y values of the user's mouse. Each circle should have a width and height of CIRCLE_SIZE (a constant defined for you in the starter code), and a color of your choosing. The animation should have a delay of DELAY (another constant defined for you in the starter code). 

As an extension, only draw a circle if the mouse is on the canvas. To do this, check that the mouse_x and mouse_y are within the boundaries of CANVAS_WIDTH and CANVAS_HEIGHT.

The program generates all circles within the Canvas boundaries.
